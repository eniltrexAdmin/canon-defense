        <h3>TODO</h3>
        <h4> Bug fixing / Missing stuff</h4>
        <p>I've been forced by me nephews to add and complete more level and more stuff. And complete stuff of this to do.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improve sound effects, better match between sounds and monsters.</li>
            <li>You cannot beat 8, I don't think you can, can you? -> correction it's beatable, and so is lvl 9</li>
            <li>Sound bug: it will trigger on enemies that are not visible yet, but close enough to be visible
              (the explanation is that the bullet "disappears" after leaving the top border, and the monster is actually
            there above the top border, so the bullet actually hits the monster- on the grapfical layer- so the
            sound is triggered, but it doesn't count, in the real game domain, the monster counts as "not visible" so
            it can't be touched, it's just a graphical bug).</li>
            <li>The same "graphical bug" also makes the monster have the "hit" animation when they appear first, and it
            gets stuck there until next turn</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Possible Future Features</h4>
        <p>Those will probably never happen.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Random Map Generator</li>
            <li>Custom Map creators</li>
            <li>Canon bonuses (multipliers?)</li>
            <li>Different kinds of canons</li>
            <li> Types of monsters/canons - so some monsters can only be hit by certain canons or get more/less damage</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A lot of stuff on that list should rely on some backend server, which will double the time...</p>
        <div id="dedication"><p>For my nephews Ethan and Arlo.</p></div>

        <p>This is a small project and I decide to leave it as is, no server needed etc, the logic can still expans and
        some of the features above can still happen. But unless somebody forces me to do it, via blackmail or -preferably- bribe,
        I will spend my time doing other projects.</p>
